GrowPath is a tool for teachers in traditional or nontraditional educational settings to demonstrate to students that they value growth and the learning process -- not simply scores, GPAs, and other traditional forms of academic measurement. With GrowPath, users (instructors) assign goals to students and, when noticing growth in the direction of the goal, plant flowers in the students' goal gardens. Users are also provided with charts, graphs, and data insights to facilitate reflection upon their goal-setting and growth-assigning tendencies according to goal categories. This provides an opportunity to make data-based changes in practices.

GrowPath was inspired by my own experiences as a Spanish teacher in a traditional, college-prep high school. While we were encouraged to incorporate "growth mindset" into our classroom practices after a few professional development seminars, ultimately the school culture continued to place enormous pressure on students to achieve traditional measures of success (i.e., test scores and GPAs). I imagined that students would buy into the concept of growth mindset more if there were concerted, visible efforts to acknowledge and reward personal growth and not simply traditional achievements.

To that end of demonstrating to students the importance of the learning process and growth, the typical user of GrowPath would be an instructor who believes that all students can move towards a goal with proper instruction/facilitation and a reason to feel hopeful, even through challenge areas. By explicitly laying out goals for each student, the instructor becomes more aware of the individual's needs and can plan accordingly to meet them, and offer the needed encouragement along the way while demonstrating through actions that the learning process itself is something to celebrate, with or without a test score.
