# Welcome to GrowPath!

GrowPath is tool for teachers in traditional or nontraditional educational settings to demonstrate to students that they value growth and the learning process over time as opposed to test scores, GPAs, and other traditional forms of academic measurement. With GrowPath, users (instructors) assign goals to students and, when noticing growth in the direction of the goal, plant flowers in the students' goal gardens. There is no determined endpoint for a goal; in other words, the student can continue growing flowers for as long as their growth continues. Users are also provided with charts/graphs and data insights to facilitate reflection upon their goal-setting and growth-assigning tendencies according to goal categories. This provides an opportunity to make data-based changes in practices. 

GrowPath was inspired by my own experiences as a Spanish teacher in a traditional, college-prep high school. While we were encouraged to incorporate "growth mindset" into our classroom practices after a few professional development seminars, ultimately the school culture contined to place enormous pressure on students to achieve traditional measures of success (i.e., test scores and GPAs) with no concrete way to show students that we truly valued their growth, or that we even noticed it. As such, students weren't quite buying it! 

To that end of demonstrating to students the importance of the learning process and growth, the typical user of GrowPath would be an instructor who believes that all students can move towards a goal with proper instruction/facilitation and a reason to feel hopeful, even through challenge areas. By explicitly laying out goals for each student, the instructor becomes more aware of the individual's needs and can plan accordingly to meet them, and offer the needed encouragement along the way while demonstrating through actions that the learning process itself is something to celebrate, with or without a test score.

## Tech Stack

GrowPath's back end was created with C#/.NET Core Web API and SQL Server connected to the front end through React with JavaScript. This project was styled through manual CSS and HTML (no component library), though React-ChartJS-2 was utilized for graphing.
